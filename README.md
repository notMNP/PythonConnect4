# PythonConnect4

This is a text-based Connect 4 game implemented in Python. It allows a human player to play against an intelligent AI opponent. The AI utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze the game state and make optimal moves, prioritizing winning moves while blocking the human player's two and three-in-a-row scenarios.

## Features:

**Interactive Gameplay:** The game provides an intuitive user interface that displays the game board. The human player can easily input their moves by selecting the desired column.

**Intelligent AI Opponent:** The AI opponent employs smart decision-making techniques to make strategic moves. It maximizes its chances of winning by setting up winning opportunities and preventing the human player from achieving three-in-a-row scenarios.

**Game Result Determination:** At the end of the game, the program determines the winner or declares a stalemate based on the game board. It 
provides clear feedback on the moves made by both the human player and the AI.

**Hall of Fame:** The program keeps track of previous winners and displays them to the user, adding a competitive element to the game.
Feel free to modify and enhance the project as per your needs. Enjoy playing Connect 4!
